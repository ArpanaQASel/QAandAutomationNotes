- **Performance Testing:**
 
i) We will do performance testing once the software is stable and moved to the production, and it may be accessed by the multiple users concurrently, due to this reason, some performance issues may occur. To avoid these performance issues, the tester performs one round of performance testing.

ii) Since it is non-functional testing which doesn't mean that we always use performance testing, we only go for performance testing when the application is functionally stable.

- **Scalability Testing:**
  
i) It is used to check an application's performance by increasing or decreasing the load in particular scales known as scalability testing. It is executed at a hardware, software, or database level.

ii) It is specified as the capacity of a network, system, application, product, or process to make the function correctly when modifications are made in the system's size or volume to meet an increasing need.

- **Compatibility Testing:**

Checking the functionality of an application on different software, hardware platforms, network and browser is known as compatibility testing.

- **Accessibility Testing:**

In software testing, accessibility testing is widely used to check the application for disabled persons and make sure the developer will create the application which can be accessible by all types of users, like a regular user and physically challenged (colour blindness, learning disabilities, and so on).
