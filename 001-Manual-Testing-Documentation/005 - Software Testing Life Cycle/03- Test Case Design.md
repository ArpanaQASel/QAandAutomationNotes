## Test Case Design: ##

Test case design is the process of planning and creating test cases that outline the steps, conditions, and expected outcomes of testing a specific aspect of a software application.

- **Write Test Cases:**

Writing test cases involves documenting detailed instructions on how to perform specific tests, including input data, steps to execute, and the expected results.

- **Review Test Cases:**

Reviewing test cases is a quality assurance step where other team members or stakeholders examine the written test cases to ensure accuracy, completeness, and adherence to requirements.

- **Test Cases Template:**

A test case template is a standardized format that outlines the structure and content of a test case, including sections for test ID, description, steps, expected results, and more.

- **Types of Test Cases:**

Test cases can be categorized into various types, such as functional, regression, integration, performance, usability, and more, each focusing on different aspects of testing.

- **Difference between Test Scenarios and Test Cases:**

Test scenarios outline high-level testing scenarios or conditions to be tested, while test cases provide detailed steps and expected outcomes for each scenario. Test scenarios are broader, while test cases are more specific.
