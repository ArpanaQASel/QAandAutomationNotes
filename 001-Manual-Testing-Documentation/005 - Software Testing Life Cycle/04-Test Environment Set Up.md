## Test Environmental Setup: ##

Test environment setup involves creating a controlled and representative environment where testing will be conducted. This includes configuring hardware, software, networks, and other resources to mimic the actual usage conditions.

- **Understand the SRS:**
  
Understanding the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is crucial for testers. The SRS document outlines the software's functionality, features, and specifications, providing the basis for designing effective test cases.

- **Hardware and Software Requirements:**

Defining hardware and software requirements involves specifying the systems, devices, and software versions needed for testing. Ensuring that the test environment matches the production environment helps simulate real-world scenarios accurately.

- **Test Data:**

Test data comprises the inputs, values, and scenarios used to execute test cases. It's important to have relevant and diverse test data to thoroughly assess the software's functionality and behavior.
