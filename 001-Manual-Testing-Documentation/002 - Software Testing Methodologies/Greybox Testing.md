 **Grey-box Testing.**

- Grey-box testing is a combination of both white-box and black-box testing. Testers who perform grey-box testing have partial knowledge of this internal code and design but not a comprehensive understanding. This approach allows testers to design test cases based on both functional specifications and some insights into the code structure.

- Internals are partially known to the tester, Testing is performed from the user prespective with access to internals


**Key Characteristics of grey-box testing:**

1) Combines elements of both white-box and black-box testing.
1) Testers have limited knowledge of the internal code and design.
1) Aims to strike a balance between code coverage and functional testing.
1) Can be particularly effective for integration testing and security testing.
1) Requires some programming skills and familiarity with the codebase.

   **For Example:** Suppose you're assembling a piece of furniture or repairing something around the house, and the instructions are missing a few steps or are unclear. You rely on your partial knowledge of DIY skills to figure out the missing details and successfully complete the task.
