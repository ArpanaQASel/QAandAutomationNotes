 ## Black-box Testing ##
 
- Black-box testing, also known as functional testing, treats the software application as a “Black-box” whose internal workings are not known to the tester. Testers who perform black-box testing focus on testing the application’s inputs, outputs and functionality without any knowledge of the underlying code.

- Internals are not known, Testing is done by the user prespective.


**Key Characteristics of black-box testing:**

1) Focuses on testing the application’s external behaviour.
1) Doesn’t require knowledge of the internal code or implementation details.
1) Test cases are designed based on requirements, specifications or user stories.
1) Aims to validate that the software meets specified requirements and functions correctly.
1) Can uncover issues related to incorrect functionality, usability and performance.

**For Example:-**
      Simple example of black-box testing is a TV. As a user, we watch the TV but we don’t need the knowledge of how the TV is built and how it works, etc. We just need to know how to operate the remote control to switch on, switch off, change channels, increase/decrease volume, etc.
