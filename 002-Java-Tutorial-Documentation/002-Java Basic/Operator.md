# Operators In java 


Operators in Java are the symbols used for performing specific operations in Java. Operators make tasks like addition, multiplication, etc. which look easy although the implementation of these tasks is quite complex.

**Types of Operators in Java :**

 
 

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
---
These operators involve the mathematical operators that can be used to perform various simple or advanced arithmetic operations on the primitive data types .

2. **Unary Operators in Java**

---

Java unary operators are the types that need only one operand to perform any operation like increment, decrement, negation, etc.

3. **Assignment Operators**

---

These operators are used to assign values to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable, and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value.

4. **Relational Operators**

---

Java Relational Operators are a bunch of binary operators used to check for relations between two operands, including equality, greater than, less than, etc. They return a boolean result .

5. **Logical Operators**

---

Logical operators are used to performing logical “AND”, “OR” and “NOT” operations, i.e. the function similar to AND gate and OR gate in digital electronics. They are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition under particular consideration.

6. **Ternary Operator**

---

Java ternary operator is the only conditional operator that takes three operands. It’s a one-liner replacement for the if-then-else statement and is used a lot in Java programming. We can use the ternary operator in place of if-else conditions or even switch conditions using nested ternary operators.

**Syntax:**
~~~
 variable = Expression1 ?  Expression2 : Expression3
~~~
