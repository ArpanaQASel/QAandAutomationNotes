## Data Types, Variables: ##

**Data Types:**

In Java, data types classify the type of data that a variable can hold. Primitive data types include int, float, double, boolean, char, etc. Reference data types include classes, interfaces, arrays, etc.

**Variables:**

Variables are containers used to store data values. They are declared with a specific data type and a unique name. 

**For example:**

// Declaration and initialization of an int variable

int age = 25;
