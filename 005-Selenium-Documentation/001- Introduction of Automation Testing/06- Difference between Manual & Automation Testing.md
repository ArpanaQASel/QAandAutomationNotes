## Manual Testing: ##

- Involves human testers executing test cases without using any automated tools.
- Relies on human observation, intuition, and experience to identify issues.
- Suitable for exploratory testing, usability testing, and ad-hoc testing.
- Time-consuming for repetitive tasks and large-scale projects.

## Automation Testing: ##

- Employs automated tools and scripts to execute predefined test cases.
- Uses predefined criteria to determine test outcomes, reducing subjectivity.
- Ideal for regression testing, performance testing, and large-scale projects.
- Efficient for repetitive tasks, providing quick and reliable results.

## Real time example: ##

**Manual Testing at Shop Ease:** 

A tester would manually navigate through the website, adding items to the cart and checking out, observing for any issues and reporting them.

**Automation Testing at Shop Ease:** 

Selenium scripts would automate the process of adding items to the cart and checking out, saving time and ensuring consistency in the testing process.
