## Criteria for Automation Test Cases: ##

**Stability:** 

Test cases that provide consistent and reliable results are suitable for automation.

**Repetitive:** 

Test cases that need to be executed repeatedly, such as in regression testing, are good candidates for automation.

**Predictable Outcome:** 

Test cases with an expected outcome that can be defined in advance are ideal for automation.

**Critical Functionality:** 

Automation should focus on testing critical functions or features of the application.

## Real time example: ##

**Stability:** 

The 'checkout' process, as it should consistently work without unexpected errors.

**Repetitive:** 

Adding items to the cart and proceeding to checkout, which is done frequently by users.
