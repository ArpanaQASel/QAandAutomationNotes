## Advantages of Automation: ##

**Faster Execution:**

Automated tests run significantly faster than manual tests, enabling quicker feedback on the application's health.

**Repeatability and Consistency:**

Automated tests ensure that the same steps are followed consistently, minimizing human errors in testing.

**Broader Test Coverage:** 

Automation allows for a more extensive range of test scenarios to be executed during a testing cycle.

**Cost-Efficiency:** 

Over the long term, automation reduces testing costs by decreasing the time and effort required for testing activities.

**Early Bug Detection:** 

Automated tests catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the cost of fixing issues in later stages.
