## Inspecting Elements in a Browser: ##

Modern web browsers provide built-in developer tools that allow you to inspect elements on a webpage. You can right-click on any element and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools. From there, you can view the HTML structure and attributes associated with each element.

**Inspecting by id:**

Right-click on the element, and in the developer tools, you'll see the HTML representation of the element with its id attribute.

**Inspecting by name:**

Similarly, elements with a name attribute can be inspected in the developer tools.

**Inspecting by class name:**

The class attribute of an element can also be inspected in the developer tools.
